# 🚢 Titanic Dataset — End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors that influenced survival.  
It combines **technical analysis + business storytelling**, making it portfolio-ready for data science interviews and executive audiences.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform end-to-end EDA (data cleaning → visualization → feature engineering).  
- Identify strongest predictors of survival.  
- Translate findings into **business insights** for decision-makers.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Gender:** Females → ~74% survival vs. ~19% for males.  
- **Class:** 1st Class → ~63% survival | 3rd Class → ~24%.  
- **Age:** Children fared better; elderly survival lower.  
- **Family Size:** Small families (2–4) survived best.  
- **Fare/Cabin:** Higher fares → higher survival odds.  

👉 *Confirms “women and children first” while highlighting socio-economic inequalities.*
